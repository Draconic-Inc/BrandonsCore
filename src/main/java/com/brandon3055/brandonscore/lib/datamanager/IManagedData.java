/**
 * Created by brandon3055 on 12/06/2017.
 * <p>
 * The idea behind managed data objects is to make saving, loading and synchronizing data as simple as possible.
 * For example you can create a ManagedInt in a tile that implements {@link IDataManager} then simply register that int and... that is.
 * The int value stored in that int object will be saved, loaded and synchronized automatically.
 * <p>
 * Note: depending on the the manager implementation you can create an object that only saves or only syncs you dont have to do both.
